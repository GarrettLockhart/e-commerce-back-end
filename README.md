## Installation instructions

Once you have the project on your computer you can open it in your command line and run

```
npm install
```

After that has finished downloading the node_modules folder you can go back to the command line and log into MySQL shell. (Be sure to use your own credentials in a .env file in the root directory of the project) Once logged into the MySQL shell you can run:

```
source db/schema.sql
```

After that you will need to exit the MySQL shell and in your terminal run:

```
npm run seed
```

And once you have done that you can run:

```
npm start
```

or to use nodemon

```
npm run dev
```

And then you can do all of your CRUD operations in something like insomnia or postman.
